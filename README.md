# gbats

gbats is a TypeScript port of the [gbajs2](https://github.com/andychase/gbajs2) library, which itself is a port of the [gbajs](https://github.com/endrift/gbajs) library to a modern JavaScript version.

This port is motivated by the fact that I was unable to find an easy way to implement a Game Boy Advance emulator with Node.js.

**CAUTION: This package does not provide a ROM, and you will need to find it yourself. Remember, downloading and using a ROM is prohibited if you do not own the original game. The contributors of the base packages or this one cannot be held responsible for the use of this package under any circumstances. Using a ROM of a game that you do not own is solely your responsibility.**
